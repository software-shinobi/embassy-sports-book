## Prologue

I did this for Her.

I did this for the Universe.

## About This Project

a sports book. a fake one.

but using real bookmaker odds.

i don't desire to sports bet, i just want to be able to track my picks.

and i want to be able to go head-to-head with greg somewhere, since i can't use fanduel abroad.

## the spicy fantasy

tell me yours, i'll you mine.

eventually it'll have this stuff:

[ ] integrate the sports book odds api
[ ] all on demend bet creation
[ ] dashboard for managing account activity
[ ] rest api with jobs server to get fresh odds
[ ] account management
[ ] support multi-tenancy


I put together a collection of content that goes into more detail about this repository.

So go read that repository documentation. Or don't, that's ok too.

Somewhere in there is RTFM humor.
