## about this project

a sports book. a fake one.

but using real bookmaker odds.

i don't desire to sports bet, i just want to be able to track my picks.

and i want to be able to go head-to-head with greg somewhere, since i can't use fanduel abroad.

this project has been desired for so long, i've created similar things, but never exactly this.

## the spicy fantasy

tell me yours, i'll you mine.

eventually it'll have this stuff:

- [ ] integrate the sports book odds api
- [ ] all on demend bet creation
- [ ] dashboard for managing account activity
- [ ] rest api with jobs server to get fresh odds
- [ ] account management
- [ ] support multi-tenancy

## what is the embassy?

My apartment. lol.

shout out to [Drake](repository-documentation/readme.md).

> All factual, I call the house "the embassy", the studio the chapel"

## ciao

From my universe to yours.
