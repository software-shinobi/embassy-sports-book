# Blackjack Game

Rules of the game

Two cards are dealt to each player, with the dealer being the last to play. Players can draw cards whenever they want, as long as they don't go over 21, which means they will have lost the hand. They can stand at any time they want, although they usually stand when they get a number close to 21.

Numerical values of the cards

- Each card numbered 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) will have a value identical to its numerical value.

- The figures (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are all worth 10 points.

- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is most convenient for a particular hand.

For example, an Ace and a Jack are equivalent to an automatic Blackjack.
